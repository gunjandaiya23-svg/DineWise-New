"""Reciprocal Rank Fusion and chunk-to-restaurant collapse.

Fusion happens at the chunk level: each retriever contributes an ordered
list of chunk ids, and RRF assigns every chunk a fused score. Restaurant
candidates are then formed by collapsing chunk hits, keeping the best
chunk score per restaurant. Attribute filters are applied to fused candidates before restaurant collapse.
